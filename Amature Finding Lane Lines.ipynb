    "<h2>Reflection</h2><br/>Throughout this project, I learned several things. I've learned that a lot of computer vision has to do with corners and edges and also that pictures are better dealt with in black and white, rather than in color. My pipeline takes an image, turns it into a grayscale image, thereafter using the canny edge detection to find edges within a certain threshold. After that, creating a triangle, it focuses on a small portion of the picture where only the lane lines lie. Using the hough transformation algorithm, it finds the lane lines and thereafter colors in the lines. Finally returning the altered picture, containing the in focus lane lines drawn.<br/><br/>My pipeline works on the first 2 videos quite well, but breaks when it attempts the challenge. I believe that the shortcoming my pipeline has is that it doesn't deal well with differing lighting/coloring on the road. If you run the challenge, you'll see the when the road gets lighter, the pipeline doesn't work at all, because my pipeline really takes advantage of the contrasts between the very black road and really white lines given in other 2 videos. One of the ways I believe to overcome this problem is to use a method of machine learning where it estimates about where the line would appear, by keeping track of them in the previous frames, and then draw those estimations on the road."
